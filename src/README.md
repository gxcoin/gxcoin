What is GxCoin?
----------------

GxCoin is an altcoin crypto-currency just like bitcoin. Uses the same technology 
and it's opensource.

Bitcoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is also the name of the open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

How it was created?
-------------------

We just forked the Satoshi 0.8.5 client, set a new name, a new currency code (GXC) 
and started mining the coins (just like bitcoin) from scratch. To bootstrap we 
mined the minimum 6000 GXC (120 blocks), so we could test it and published the code 
online right after on git. It will grow from here just like any other altcoin.

How many GXC can there be?
--------------------------

The same as in bitcoin (version 0.8.5).

What is the difference from bitcoin?
------------------------------------

The name, the currency name, small blockchain (when compared to BTC), since we only 
started mining in September 2015.

Why use it?
-----------

You have a much greater chance of earning coins (and faster), since the blockchain 
is smaller (started only in September 2015). With BTC there is already few years and 
many blocks completed, so this means the difficulty and hardware required to mine 
is much more expensive.

How much is worth one GXC?
--------------------------

Our initial exchange rate is for 1 GXC equals 1 BTC. The open market (between sellers 
and buyers) will decided the right market exchange rate for GXC.
